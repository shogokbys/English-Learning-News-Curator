# English Learning News Curator
This application is designed to help users curate news articles and turn them into effective study materials for improving English reading and listening skills. It also includes comprehension questions that encourage logical thinking and deep understanding. While the primary audience is English learners, this tool is equally beneficial for anyone looking to enhance their critical thinking and language skills.

## Features
- Web GUI Interaction: Users can input a URL through the web interface.
- Automated Content Processing:
  - Fetches and summarises the article from the provided URL.
  - Estimates the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) level of the content.
  - Generates comprehension questions to facilitate understanding and logical thinking.
  - Saves all data as a database entry in Notion.
- Audio Generation: Converts the main body of the article into an MP3 file and saves it to Google Drive for listening practice.
